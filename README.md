# Arduino_DHT-MEMS-Temp-Humi-Sensors
It is a sample project for DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor with Arduino board.

The sample project uses the DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor to measure the temperature and humidity of the environment. It displays the temperature and humidity values in real-time on a 16x2 LCD with I2C adaptor. When the ambient temperature exceeds a certain threshold, the system activates the 28BYJ-48 stepper motor to drive the mechanical part (fan blades) for rotation.
